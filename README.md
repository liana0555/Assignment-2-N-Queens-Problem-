# Assignment-2-N-Queens-Problem-

## Project Overview

This project explores and compares classical and metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as DFS, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm algorithm to solve the N-queens problem. We can study how different algorithms work in combinatorial optimization problems.

The purpose of the project is:
- Understanding the behavior of algorithms when used in different sizes.
- Measurement of execution time, memory usage, and solution success.
- Visualization of solution attempts with clear conclusions on the board.

## Key Features
- Implementation of the N-Queens task in pure Python.
- Optimization algorithms written from scratch:
- DFS (depth-first search)
- Climbing the hill
- Simulated annealing
- The genetic algorithm
- Customizable board sizes: N = 10, 30, 50, 100.
- Visual indicators of successful and unsuccessful decisions.
- Detailed statistics: memory, time, result.

## My code
- n_queens_main.py = Entry point, choose algorithm and run.
- dfs_n_queens.py = Depth-First Search algorithm. 
- hill_climbing_n_queens.py = Hill Climbing algorithm.
- simulated_annealing_n_queens.py = Simulated Annealing algorithm.
- genetic_n_queens.py = Genetic Algorithm.
Timer and memory profiling, board class, helper functions and so on are inside of these codes.
